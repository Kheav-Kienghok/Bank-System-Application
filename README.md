# MyBANK Banking Application

## Overview
The MyBANK Banking Application is a simple banking system implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQLite for database management. It allows users to create bank accounts, log in, deposit and withdraw funds, and view their account balances.

2. **Login**: Registered users can log in to their accounts using their username (first name) and PIN.
3. **Deposit**: Users can deposit funds into their accounts.
4. **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts.
5. **Transaction History**: The application records transaction history, including deposits and withdrawals, for each user.
6. **GUI Interface**: The application provides a graphical user interface for ease of use.
